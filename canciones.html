<h1> tv girl Cigarettes out the Window:</h1><br>
<p>My girl Liddy used to always smoke<br>
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep<br>
She'd disappear for an hour and a half<br>
And when she'd come back she'd brush her teeth<br>
But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee<br>
And I could taste it on her lips when we kiss<br>
Poor little Liddy used to always quit<br>
But she never really quit<br>
She'd just say she did<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
My girl Liddy used to always smoke<br>
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep<br>
I wonder what she did when she got done<br>
I guess she'd just flick them out in the street<br>
Poor little Liddy, she wishes it was dark<br>
But it's never really dark in L.A.<br>
The light from the billboard always shines<br>
But it changed twelve times since you went away<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)<br>
We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty<br>
Because when you call my name through them<br>
There will be no answer<br>
Rather melodramatic, aren't you?<br>
We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty<br>
Because when you call my name through them<br>
There will be no answer<br>
You mind if I smoke?<br>
We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty<br>
Because when you call my name through them<br>
There will be no answer<br>
I always smoke in the theater<br>
We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty<br>
Because when you call my name through them<br>
There'll be no answer<br>
Somehow it enhances the performance<br>

<h1>505 arctic monkeys <br>
<p>I'm going back to 505<br>
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side<br>
With your hands between your thighs<br>
Stop and wait a sec'<br>
Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?<br>
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br>
Or I did last time I checked<br>
Not shy of a spark<br>
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark<br>
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark<br>
The middle of adventure is such a perfect place to start<br>
I'm going back to 505<br>
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side<br>
With your hands between your thighs<br>
But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise<br>
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br>
I'm going back to 505<br>
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side<br>
With your hands between your thighs and a smile<br>
</p>

 <br>
boys donÂ´t cry:
<p>I would say I'm sorry if I thought that it would change your mind<br>
But I know that this time<br>
I have said too much<br>
Been too unkind<br>
I try to laugh about it<br>
Cover it all up with lies<br>
I try to laugh about it<br>
Hiding the tears in my eyes<br>
'Cause boys don't cry<br>
Boys don't cry<br>
I would break down at your feet and beg forgiveness<br>
Plead with you<br>
But I know that it's too late<br>
And now there's nothing I can do<br>
So, I try to laugh about it<br>
Cover it all up with lies<br>
I try to laugh about it<br>
Hiding the tears in my eyes<br>
'Cause boys don't cry<br>
Boys don't cry<br>
I would tell you that I loved you<br>
If I thought that you would stay<br>
But I know that it's no use<br>
That you've already gone away<br>
Misjudged your limit<br>
Pushed you too far<br>
Took you for granted<br>
Thought that you needed me more, more, more<br>
Now I would do most anything to get you back by my side<br>
But I just keep on laughing<br>
Hiding the tears in my eyes<br>
'Cause boys don't cry<br>
Boys don't cry<br>
Boys don't cry<br>
